# Count-to-50
Nichoals Williams
CIS20231N1 Linux
This is a simple Bash script that counts from 1 to 50 and prints the numbers to the terminal.

For this project, I took pictures of my terminal commands while working on my personal Linux computer. 
Everything was done in the terminal, except for creating my GitHub account on the website.
I had to use my personal email because I couldn't access my school email at the moment.
